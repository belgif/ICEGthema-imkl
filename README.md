ICEG thema repository for the thematic traject "Cables and Pipes".

This GitHub has two main branches:
    * "Standaardenregister" contains documentation on the process of the IMKL 3.0 update (presentations, meeting reports, recordings)
    * "Implementation" contains source information for publication of the online specification (semantic model) and the implementation model (i.e. codelists). It is actually the backend for publication towards the frontend.

In this read-me section, we will give some guidance on the content of the "implementation branch"
    * 'Config': configuration of the semantic datamodel. This is the source for publication of the online specification (https://belgif.github.io/thematic/models/cable-pipe/)
    * 'Implementation': contains all information on the implementation model (codelists etc.). This is the source for publication of the codelists (https://vocab.belgif.be/auth?lang=en)
    * 'Resources': contains general information (background information, data exemples,...)
    * 'Site skeleton': this section contains a structure to set-up the visualisation (Html publication)
    * 'Templates': context setting (textual information) for the online specification of the semantic datamodel
    * 'Translation': translations NL-FR-EN for the online specification of the semantic datamodel
    * 'IMKL-LD.eap': UML-scheme 
    * 'Stakeholders': concerned parties for the semantic datamodel trajectory

    For publication of changes made in the backend (GitHub) a manual approval of pull requests needs to be done.
    For publication towards Belgif websites (both semantic model and code lists) an extra manual approval needs to be done by an ICEG employee.
